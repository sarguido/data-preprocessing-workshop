    "# Standardizing data for machine learning\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is standardization?\n",
    "\n",
    "Standardization is a preprocessing method used to transform continuous data to make it look normally distributed. In scikit-learn, this is often a necessary step, because many models assume that the data you are training on is normally distributed, and if it isn't, you risk biasing your model. You can standardize your data in different ways, but in this workshop we're going to talk about two methods: log normalization and scaling. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few different scenarios in which you want to standardize your data. First, if you're working with any kind of model that uses a linear distance metric or operates in a linear space like k-nearest neighbors, linear regression, or k-means clustering, the model is assuming that the data and features you're giving it are related in a linear fashion, or can be measured with a linear distance metric. There are a number of models that deal with nonlinear spaces, but for those models that are in a linear space, the data must also be in that space.\n",
    "\n",
    "The case when a feature or features in your dataset have high variance is similar. This could bias a model that assumes the data is normally distributed. If a feature in your dataset has a variance that's an order of magnitude or more greater than the other features, this could impact the model's ability to learn from other features in the dataset. Also, modeling a dataset that contains continuous features that are on different scales is another scenario to watch out for. For example, consider a dataset that contains a column related to height and another related to weight. In order to compare these features, they must be in the same linear space, and therefore must be standardized in some way.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Log normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "Log normalization is a method for standardizing your data that can be useful when you have a particular column with high variance. Log normalization applies a log transformation to your values, which transforms your values onto a scale that approximates normality, an assumption about data that a lot of machine learning models make. The method of log normalization we're going to work with in Python takes the natural log of each number, which is simply the exponent you would raise above the mathematical constant _e_ (approximately equal to 2.718) to get that number.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Log normalization is a good strategy when you care about relative changes in a linear model, when you still want to capture the magnitude of change, and when you want to keep everything in the positive space. It's a nice way to minimize the variance of a column and make it comparable to other columns for modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how this works in Python. Here we have a small dataset where one of the columns, `col2`, has high variance. We can check the variance across a set of data using the `.var()` method:"

    "Scaling is a method of standardization that's most useful when you're working with a dataset that contains continuous features that are on different scales, and you're using a model that operates in some sort of linear space (like linear regression or k-nearest neighbors). Feature scaling transforms the features in your dataset so they have a mean of zero and a variance of one. This will make it easier to linearly compare features.
