    "### What is feature selection?\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature selection is a method of selecting features from your feature set to be used for modeling. It draws from a set of existing features, so it's different than feature engineering because it doesn't create new features. The goal of feature selection is to improve your model's performance. Perhaps your existing feature set is much too large, or some of the features you're working with are unnecessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Removing features manually\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the easiest ways to determine if a feature is unnecessary is if it is redundant in some way. For example, if it exists in another form as another featureâ€”sometimes, when you create features through feature engineering, you end up duplicating existing features in some way. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if your dataset contains repeated information in its feature set, it's unlikely you'll need to use each feature for modeling. You may see columns related to city, state, latitude, and longitude in the same dataset, such as in the `volunteer` dataset:"

    "Another situation where duplicate features occur is through feature engineering. In an earlier example, we took an average on running times from a group of people to use as an aggregate statistic. It's likely that we could drop the values that generated the aggregate statistic.

    "\n",
    "We'll use Pearson's correlation coefficient to check a feature set for correlation. The Pearson correlation coefficient is a measure of this directionality: a score closer to 1 between pairs of features means that they move together in the same direction more strongly, a score closer to 0 means features are not correlated, and a score close to -1 means they are more strongly negatively correlated, meaning one feature increases in value while the other decreases. \n",

In terms of feature selection, it can be a useful method when you have a large number of features and no strong candidates for elimination.\n",
