    "### What is feature selection?\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature selection is a method of selecting features from your feature set to be used for modeling. It draws from a set of existing features, so it's different than feature engineering because it doesn't create new features. The goal of feature selection is to improve your model's performance. Perhaps your existing feature set is much too large, or some of the features you're working with are unnecessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different ways you can perform feature selection. It's possible to do it in an automated way. Scikit-learn has several methods for automated feature selection, such as choosing a variance threshold and using univariate statistical tests, but we won't cover those here. \n",
    "\n",
    "Feature selection can help to get rid of noise in your model. Perhaps you have redundant features, like latitude and longitude, city, and state. Or maybe you have features that are strongly statistically correlated, which breaks the assumptions of certain models and thus impacts model performance. If your feature set is large, it may be beneficial to use dimensionality reduction to combine and reduce the number of features in your dataset in a way that also reduces the overall variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Removing features manually\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the easiest ways to determine if a feature is unnecessary is if it is redundant in some way. For example, if it exists in another form as another featureâ€”sometimes, when you create features through feature engineering, you end up duplicating existing features in some way. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if your dataset contains repeated information in its feature set, it's unlikely you'll need to use each feature for modeling. You may see columns related to city, state, latitude, and longitude in the same dataset, such as in the `volunteer` dataset:"

    "Perhaps, for your modeling task, you only need the high-level state information in the `region` field, which we didn't drop. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another situation where duplicate features occur is through feature engineering. In an earlier example, we calculated a number of aggregate statistics on running times. The columns we had were times from 5 separate runs as well as mean, median, total, and fastest time. We could likely drop the values that generated the aggregate statistic. Feature selection, like most aspects of the machine learning pipeline, is very dependent on the model you're trying to build.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Removing correlated features\n",
    "\n",
    "Another clear situation in which you'd want to drop features is when they are statistically correlated, meaning they move together directionally. Linear models in particular assume that features are independent of each other, and if features are strongly correlated, that could introduce bias into your model. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use Pearson's correlation coefficient to check a feature set for correlation. The Pearson correlation coefficient is a measure of this directionality: a score closer to 1 between pairs of features means that they move together in the same direction more strongly, a score closer to 0 means features are not correlated, and a score close to -1 means they are more strongly negatively correlated, meaning one feature increases in value while the other decreases. \n",

    "Correlation isn't usually as clear-cut as this. You can also see that columns 2 and 4 have a relatively high correlation at around 0.7.

    "\n",
    "The method of dimensionality reduction we'll cover is principal component analysis, or PCA. PCA uses a linear transformation to project features into a space where they are completely uncorrelated. While the feature space is reduced, the variance is captured in a meaningful way by combining features into components. PCA captures, in each component, as much of the variance in the dataset as possible. In terms of feature selection, it can be a useful method when you have a large number of features and no strong candidates for elimination.\n",

PCA is more of a black box method than other methods of dimensionality reduction. The other thing to note is that PCA is a good step to do at the end of your preprocessing journey, because of the way the data gets transformed and reshaped. It can be difficult to do much feature work post-PCA, other than eliminating components that aren't useful in explaining variance.\n",
